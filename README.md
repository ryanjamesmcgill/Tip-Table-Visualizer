# Tip-Table-Visualizer
A Visual Basic/SQL application developed for Excel 2010 to be used in a large scale semiconductor manufacturing facility.

This program was part of an Excel macro that created a visual representation of a collection of database tables that engineers often needed to monitor and manipulate. Originally, the engineers interacted with a raw spread sheet representation of these tables. This was manually intensive, prone to error, and slow. The Tip-Table-Visualizer was made to help the engineer's make sense of the tables contents much more quickly by the use of pivot tables, dynamic layout, comments and color. The image below is an example of how the application works, the user specifies some search parameters that are injected into the SQL queries, then the program creates the layout for the data returned.
